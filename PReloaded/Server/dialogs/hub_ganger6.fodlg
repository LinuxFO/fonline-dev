{100}{}{Алкоголик}
{200}{}{Вы видите пьяницу.}
{210}{}{Вы видите шатающегося из стороны в сторону пьяного человека в лохмотьях. Лицо его распухло, нос синющий как слива. А аромат рядом с ним такой, что свалит брамина насмерть. Он что-то бормочет про себя и иногда громко поет песни.}
{210}{}{Вы видите алкаша. Он весьма грязен - кажется, он повалялся в луже, но не особо этим расстроен.}

{6010}{}{I've got more.}
{6020}{}{Okay bye!}
{7000}{}{[You're standing before a typical caravan guard. This one looks disciplined, experienced, and mean. They try to quickly grab your attention as you approach] Say pal! Do me a favour will you? If you're running into town could you pick me up a trio of Stimpaks? I'll give you my old Tools in return. }
{7010}{}{I'll think about it. }
{7020}{}{No. Too busy. Bye.}

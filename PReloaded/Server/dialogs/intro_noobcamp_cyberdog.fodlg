{100}{}{Outdated Cyberdog}
{200}{}{You see an old Vault-Tek Cyberhound.}
{210}{}{Doesn't look like it's working at all, might need some repairs.}
{1000}{}{Predialogue installations}
{1010}{}{not known}
{1020}{}{completed}
{2000}{}{[You find what appears to be a barely functional Vault-Tek Cyberhound, and although it's an older model you remember reading much about them in a comic book growing up in the vault]}
{2010}{}{[Fiddle with the processor]}
{2020}{}{[Attempt to play fetch with the dog]}
{2030}{}{[Give it a good kick]}
{2040}{}{[Plug its brain into your PipBoy and run the diagnostics]}
{2050}{}{Ah screw it! I'm done! Stupid dogs. I need to learn more about science before attempting this again.}
{3000}{}{[You fiddle with the processor but find that it does absolutely nothing. Should have bought American] [Reqs 30x Science]}
{3010}{}{What if I...}
{3020}{}{Ah screw it! I'm done! Stupid dogs.}
{4000}{}{[You throw a stick at the dog but it just feels cruel. Maybe you should stop?] [Reqs 30x Science]}
{4010}{}{What if I...}
{4020}{}{Ah screw it! I'm done! Stupid dogs.}
{5000}{}{[You give the robotic pooch quite a good thrashing, but you only manage to hurt your foot... And your pride] [Reqs 30x Science]}
{5010}{}{What if I...}
{5020}{}{Ah screw it! I'm done! Stupid dogs.}
{6000}{}{[You plug the Cyberhound TM' s brain into your PipBoy and start up the diagnostics program. A few moments later a piece of garbled code appears] ERROR ELECTRONIC HARDWARE FAILED! REPLACE INTERNAL HARD DRIVE! PLEASE CONTACT YOUR SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR FOR MORE INFORMATION! [Looks like you'll need a new part to get this beast working]}
{6010}{}{[Replace and reformat the internal hard drive]}
{6020}{}{What if I...}
{6030}{}{Ah screw it! I'm done! Stupid dogs.}
{7000}{}{[After installing the new part you attempt to quickly wipe the data from the dog's brain and give it a reset. But a strange menu pops-up and says] GЗЋixiД› yГ¬ngjiГ n shГ№jГ№ bГ¬ng jГ¬xГ№ ma? (еђѕи‰ѕ) (и‰ѕеЁњ)}
{7010}{}{What the hell? Where's the hologram interface?}
{8000}{}{[This primitive computer language is puzzling to you, do you push the GHWYS or SJAKHE button?]}
{8010}{}{GHWYS}
{8020}{}{SJAKHE}
{9000}{}{[You quickly push the "Y" key and patiently wait as the new data is overriden into the machine's brain. After a short pause the light inside the dog's cranium begins to light up and glow a menacing red]}
{9010}{}{Uh...Okay...}
{10000}{}{[A sequence of numbers is seen inside the robot's eyes but quickly disapears. Your PipBoy vibrates and sends you a pop-up it reads] Push any key to continue. [Well where's the "any key" you wonder?]}
{10010}{}{[Close your eyes and push a random key]}
{11000}{}{[You cleverly push the closest button to your right hand and hope for the best. Looks like it worked! The Vault-Tek Cyberhound flickers back to life and begins it's patrol. Great success!]}
{11010}{}{Boy! I sure am smart! Time to rip out these cables!}
{12000}{}{[You improve your Science skill by 6%!]}
{12010}{}{Ugh..I should have done that more gently...}
{13000}{}{@@Does not compute.@@*Beep!* *Beep!*@@ERROR.@@Arf! Arf!@@Brought to you by Vault-Tek!@@*Growls*@@*Pants*@@*Barks!*@@Patrolling!@@Greetings, citizen!}
{100000001}{}{Better wash the counter again...}
{100000002}{}{That's 5 caps buddy. Hey did you hear me? Cough em' up.}
{100000003}{}{Better change the keg...}
{100000004}{}{RotGut? You drink that shit?}
{100000005}{}{Domestic? I got B.E.E.R buddy, do you want one or not?}
{100000006}{}{Fuckin' dust is getting everywhere. Hey close the fuckin' door!}
{100000007}{}{I swear if the next asshole doesn't tip. Ima' shoot somebody!}
{100000008}{}{I got bottles, I got shots, and I got a bat behind the counter for the retards. Your not a retard are you?}
{100000009}{}{Uh-huh, yeah that's nice buddy. You don't say...What? Of course I'm listening...}
{100000010}{}{That's 5 caps. FIVE CAPS Tribal! F.I.V.E! }
{100000011}{}{Shut up and order a fuckin' beer already!}
{100000012}{}{I swear if I have to serve another drunk, I'm getting the shotgun!}
{100000013}{}{Look the keg went dry, and it's going to be another month until the caravan shows up again.}
{100000014}{}{Really? You don't say, buy another drink or get out!}
{100000015}{}{What? I'm on break.}
{100000016}{}{Be right with ya'}
{100000017}{}{Have a sit stranger. I'll be with you in a moment.}
{100000018}{}{When do we close? Uh, when the place get's shot up, that's when!}
{100000019}{}{We're fresh outta' cold beer, sorry. You'll just have to drink it warm.}
{100000020}{}{RotGut? No man, go make that shit yourself! I wouldn't drink it!}

[russ]
{100}{}{Алкоголик}
{200}{}{Вы видите пьяницу.}
{210}{}{Вы видите шатающегося из стороны в сторону пьяного человека в лохмотьях. Лицо его распухло, нос синющий как слива. А аромат рядом с ним такой, что свалит брамина насмерть. Он что-то бормочет про себя и иногда громко поет песни.}
{210}{}{Вы видите алкаша. Он весьма грязен - кажется, он повалялся в луже, но не особо этим расстроен.}

{2000}{}{Thank you! Thank you! }
{2010}{}{Head to the camp}

{2040}{}{Answer 4}
{2050}{}{Ah screw it! I'm done! Stupid dogs.}

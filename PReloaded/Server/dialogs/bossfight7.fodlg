{1010}{}{Answer text}
{2000}{}{Come closer, and hear the tale of The Ambassador of Pain.}
{2010}{}{Tell me your story, old man. I am not afraid.}
{2020}{}{Silence your words! Your story is no longer truth. The Ambassador of Pain is dead!}
{2030}{}{Hmm, I'll have to come back later.}
{2040}{}{Maybe some other time, I don't think I'm ready for this.}
{3000}{}{Once there was a judge, an honest man by any other name. He brought justice across the wastes, and united the government.

{3010}{}{Go on...}
{4000}{}{A fate so terrible, it took the once proud hero, and turned him into a horrible monster of a man. A broken shell, with the strength of an atom bomb! For when those wastelanders took his family away, it took both his spirit, innocence... and humanity! He know walks these lands known as the Ambassador of Pain! And will make all who hear his name suffer a terrible fate just as he once did!}
{4010}{}{*Gulp* Go on...}

{5010}{}{[Challenge the Legendary Villain?]}
{5020}{}{[Throw the paper away, and leave, refusing to fight]}
{6000}{}{I too, am afraid, young adventurer.}
{7000}{}{It is done! The Ambassador of Pain is dead! Thank the name of @pname@! May their story be told across the ocean!}
{8000}{}{Prepare yourself, this is no ordinary politician.}

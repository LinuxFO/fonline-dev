{2000}{}{[This girl appears to be lost in another world] My pretties! Grow! Grow, I say! Oh how will I ever feed all of my children! Ah! You there! Could you please spare a moment of your time?}
{2010}{}{Sure thing ma'am, what do you need?}
{2020}{}{Ugh... Maybe...}
{2030}{}{You're quite the loon aren't you?}
{2040}{}{Not right now, sorry.}
{3000}{}{[She's looking through you, at least that's what it seems like] Wonderful news! My precious children will grow indeed! Surely you won't disapoint?}
{3010}{}{What the hell are you talking about?}
{3020}{}{Uh, no ma'am, what do you need?}
{4000}{}{[Now she's looking at you, kind of creepy] Why! I need water bags of course! How else will I carry the burden of thirst upon my shoulders? One for each shoulder of course! Two to guide the journey!}
{4010}{}{Uh, what?}
{4020}{}{Two water bags? That's all?}
{5000}{}{[Okay, now you're getting pretty creeped out] Two moons, two bags, two gods. May she walk over you as you watch over my plants. }
{5010}{}{Okay, I'll be back with two water bags.}
{5020}{}{How the hell do I even make a water bag?}
{6000}{}{[She smiles and continues watering her plants] May the Earth bless and keep you safe, my child. }
{6010}{}{Uh, you too. Goodbye.}
{7000}{}{[She spreads her arms out to the sky and says] You must ask the Earth to give you the hides of your brethren, and quickly tie a knot at the tips before the blood dries. It is this moisture that allows the case to form, but do not waste the life that the Earth gives. }
{7010}{}{Okay let me get this straight. I need a brahmin hide, and a piece of fiber? Okay that's easy enough, I'll be back. }
{8000}{}{[She spreads her arms out to the sky and says] I am the trees, I am the wind, I am life about to begin!}
{8010}{}{Sure, well, I'm here to help.}
{9000}{}{[She's trying hard to remember you, but she manages] Has the Mother brought me the two filled water bags, I so ever prayed hard for?}
{9010}{}{Will this work?}
{9020}{}{Yup, here you go! I even filled it.}
{9030}{}{Sorry not yet, I'll be back. Tell Mother not to worry.}
{10000}{}{[She gives you the most ackward hug you've ever had] The Earth blesses my garden! Thank you! I will tell the Captain what wonderful help you've been! [She goes back to watering her plants] I'll even give you my old water bag, before you leave!}
{10010}{}{Ugh, thanks [Walk away with a shrug]}
{11000}{}{But the Earth dies! You must hurry!}
{12000}{}{@@Now the flowers will grow!@@Thank you again! Ever so much!}
{13000}{}{These are empty! Go find what looks like a post and fill it up.}
{100000001}{}{Better wash the counter again...}
{100000002}{}{That's 5 caps buddy. Hey did you hear me? Cough em' up.}
{100000003}{}{Better change the keg...}
{100000004}{}{RotGut? You drink that shit?}
{100000005}{}{Domestic? I got B.E.E.R buddy, do you want one or not?}
{100000006}{}{Fuckin' dust is getting everywhere. Hey close the fuckin' door!}
{100000007}{}{I swear if the next asshole doesn't tip. Ima' shoot somebody!}
{100000008}{}{I got bottles, I got shots, and I got a bat behind the counter for the retards. Your not a retard are you?}
{100000009}{}{Uh-huh, yeah that's nice buddy. You don't say...What? Of course I'm listening...}
{100000010}{}{That's 5 caps. FIVE CAPS Tribal! F.I.V.E! }
{100000011}{}{Shut up and order a fuckin' beer already!}
{100000012}{}{I swear if I have to serve another drunk, I'm getting the shotgun!}
{100000013}{}{Look the keg went dry, and it's going to be another month until the caravan shows up again.}
{100000014}{}{Really? You don't say, buy another drink or get out!}
{100000015}{}{What? I'm on break.}
{100000016}{}{Be right with ya'}
{100000017}{}{Have a sit stranger. I'll be with you in a moment.}
{100000018}{}{When do we close? Uh, when the place get's shot up, that's when!}
{100000019}{}{We're fresh outta' cold beer, sorry. You'll just have to drink it warm.}
{100000020}{}{RotGut? No man, go make that shit yourself! I wouldn't drink it!}

{100}{}{Алкоголик}
{200}{}{Вы видите пьяницу.}
{210}{}{Вы видите шатающегося из стороны в сторону пьяного человека в лохмотьях. Лицо его распухло, нос синющий как слива. А аромат рядом с ним такой, что свалит брамина насмерть. Он что-то бормочет про себя и иногда громко поет песни.}
{210}{}{Вы видите алкаша. Он весьма грязен - кажется, он повалялся в луже, но не особо этим расстроен.}

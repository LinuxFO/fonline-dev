{200}{}{Вы видите пьяницу.}
{210}{}{Вы видите шатающегося из стороны в сторону пьяного человека в лохмотьях. Лицо его распухло, нос синющий как слива. А аромат рядом с ним такой, что свалит брамина насмерть. Он что-то бормочет про себя и иногда громко поет песни.}
{210}{}{Вы видите алкаша. Он весьма грязен - кажется, он повалялся в луже, но не особо этим расстроен.}

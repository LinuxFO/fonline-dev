{5000}{}{Whiskey is $10 a shot.}
{5010}{}{Here’s your money.}

{8000}{}{Information I do not have.}
{8010}{}{Really? How about why Becky’s drinks are so much cheaper than yours?}
{8020}{}{I thought bartenders knew everything. I want something else.}

{14000}{}{There was? What?}
{14010}{}{He's, uh, charging double this time.}
{15000}{}{(Frankie's face reddens) That stingy piece of shit! He tries this every goddamn time. I give that old fucker the most business he's ever had and he... shit. I need a drink.}
{15010}{}{Can I go now? Is that it? }
{16000}{}{No! Not it ain't! Not by a long shot. You get back to Bob, tell him I'll be picking up, but at the goddamn rate we agreed on! (He sighs) Here's a couple bucks for your trouble. Don't keep me waiting.}

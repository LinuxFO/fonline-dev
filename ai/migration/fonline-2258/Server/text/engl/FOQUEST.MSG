{16129002}{}{I can hear footsteps! Someone's following me! It must be the same person that killed Cira! I need to go chase after them! This is a perfect opportunity to get some answers! I've marked the stranger's location on my map, and need to go there right now! I'd better get ready for a fight!}
{16129003}{}{Rest in peace, my sweet Cira. This is too weird! Why is someone from my vault trying to kill me? Did the Overseer hire this guy? Or what? This isn't over! I need to find some answers! But how? Maybe I should check out the nearest Vault. That would be Vault 15 according to my PipBoy. I wonder what I'll find there?}
{16129004}{}{I need to get the hell out of here! My PipBoy tells me that the next closest vault is Vault 8. I should continue my journey there, and get access to one of their computers. Maybe I can access their database without having to enter their Vault? Cira... I... miss you.}
{16129005}{}{Cira? You were pregnant? Why didn't you tell me? What the hell have I gotten myself into? I need to go to Gecko and see what Skeeter has to say about this "part" for Vault 24. I can't help but feel like something sinister is going on! I need to be careful!}
{16129006}{}{I guess now I'm off to Redding to deliver this part. I wonder what it does? And just why the hell the Overseer needs it? Who knows. What's more important is where I'm supposed to deliver it? I didn't receive much direction... better just follow my instincts on this one.}
{16129007}{}{Jesus! What is going on? Why is the Overseer making me jump through all these hoops? I have this letter I'm supposed to deliver to Councilwoman McClaire of Vault City, but should I deliver it? That stranger in the vault suit did say something about a reward? I don't know. Haven't I done enough damage to Vault City? Guess I'll find out.}
{16129008}{}{I think I'm way over my head right now! It looks like my Overseer had me hack into Vault City and plant a virus just so he could blackmail them for whatever reason, I don't know! After delivering his letter to McClaire, I'm now expected to head over to New Reno and talk to a man named Bishop, and take someone's place! I need to be careful around New Reno, it's not safe over there.}
{16129009}{}{Bishop and McClaire are making me do something I don't really want to do. I have to go to this location on my map, and slaughter everyone there. I'm going to give the Overseer a piece of my mind if I ever see him again! But right now, I just need to get this over with. I should get ready for a fight. Duty calls.}
{16129010}{}{I hope these guys weren't members of my vault! What the hell have I done?! What the hell am I becoming?! I need to wash this all away! Better get out of here and tell McClaire I'm done with this madness!}
{16129011}{}{McClaire paid me a decent wage for doing what I just did... But still... It doesn't feel right. She gave me another letter to deliver. This time I'm supposed to go back to Redding and find the same man as before. }
{16129012}{}{Time to get the hell out of the North, and back into the South. This place is too hostile for me. I feel much more at home near the Hub, what a shame. I guess I should head to this "Library" next, and find that Katrina woman, see what she wants. I still can't believe Cira is dead... all for nothing. Did I kill the madman responsible? Or is he still out there?}
{16129013}{}{Get to Level 12 to Continue the Story. Return to Katrina in the L.A Library when you're ready, and tough enough to continue. Good luck! Vault Dweller!}
{16129014}{}{What the hell is this? A book? There's nothing in this thing. Just blank page after blank page. I'd better go deliver it to the Post Office in the Hub.}
{16129015}{}{I should check my mail while I'm at the Post Office in the Hub...}
{16129016}{}{Looks like there's someone waiting for me outside of the Hub... Better go see what they want. I should get ready for a fight, just in case.}
{16129017}{}{I just killed my cousin Felix! Holy crap! That bastard never did like me! But why the hell did he have to try to kill me! That monster! I found a letter on his body, it read, "Agent Felix. Target will be at the Hub. Eliminate and remove PipBoy. Bring it to San Francisco. Western Office. Payment will be waiting. Good luck." It's always about money, isn't it? My own blood would murder me for a handful of bottle caps. Looks like I'm going to San Francisco. Someone's going to answer for this.}
{16129018}{}{Someone in black armour hired my cousin Felix to kill me. He's probably the same guy that killed Cira! It doesn't feel like I brought her killer to justice yet! No, no! This isn't over! This will NEVER be over! Cira! Oh God! Why did I ever leave her behind?! What's wrong with me! She was my best friend, and I just abandoned her! And for what?! This?! The "Outside"?! If anyone deserves all this hell, it's me! And I'm going to make this whole world pay! I wonder if I have any mail?}
{16129019}{}{I need to hack into the San Francisco's Government Mainframe using my Pipboy, and install that backdoor virus I used earlier in Vault City. I guess I'll need to find a working computer, and a quiet room to do this in. Better follow my instincts on this one. What could possibly go wrong? I just need to play it quiet, and keep my head down. Just blend in... yeah right!}
{16129020}{}{Looks like I'll need a 24-digit pin to access the San Francisco Mainframe. Where the hell can I find admin access? Maybe someone here is willing to let me get my hands a little dirty?}
{16129021}{}{Looks like the only way into that Mainframe is through a big bag of bottle caps... I'll need to bribe Ken Lee, in San Francisco, with 5000 caps in order to get that 24-digit pin. Where the hell am I going to find that amount of money?}
{16129022}{}{Now that I've got a 24-digit pin for the San Francisco Mainframe, I can finally get my hands into that big, electric jar of peanut butter! Let's see what's inside, shall we?}
{16129023}{}{I can't help but feel like there's something off with that Overseer of mine. Since when have we ever broke out in song? Singing the American National Anthem at that? I felt like it was almost... instinct. I need to head over to Navarro, and see what I can find out. That's the only area around that has people in "black armour". I'd better be careful. These guys are real professional. I bet they're the ones with the guns big enough to do that much damage to a person... Cira... you... you were so precious.}
{16129024}{}{Better get ready for a serious fight! This guy looks tough! But I need to take him out in order to figure out who these people really are! I've marked a good spot to ambush the soldier on my map. I'd better hurry and get there before he does!}
{16129025}{}{That was a lot harder than I thought it would be! Jesus! Let's have a look at this body. Let's see now...Well, he's a white American. Got an American flag on his uniform. Says "Property of the U.S Government" on it, and something about an "Enclave". This must be the same organization that tried to kill me! Probably the same people that opened the doors to my beloved vault! It meant so much to me getting outside, but I never thought that I'd lose everything that I've ever loved in the process! I need to get a hold of my Overseer somehow. I should head back to San Francisco and see if that terminal is still working. }
{16129026}{}{Upon pulling out my PipBoy I noticed that there was a small email left in it. It read, "Come to NCR. Find Videocom. Overseer.". Guess I'm going to the NCR now, they must have a public Vault-Tek Videocom I can use. I just need to find somewhere public with a lot of machines, and electronics. There must be a private room over there I could use to talk to my Overseer.}
{16129027}{}{Damn! I guess Vault-Tek didn't plan on bottle caps being the new currency across the wastes! I guess I should head over to a Bank and see if they have any coins, or something.}
{16129028}{}{Looks like I'll have to pay one of these Bankers 12,480 bottle caps if I want to get in contact with my Overseer! Damnit! Where am I going to find that kind of money? I should explore the cities and see if anybody has any Jobs for me. Once I have enough bottle caps to buy some All-American Pre-War coins I should head back to the NCR, and buy the coins from that Banker. It will be a lot safer for me.}
{16129029}{}{Damn! The Chinese Government is right outside of the NCR waiting for me! They can't be happy that I hacked into their networks! If I don't take care of this now, I'll be hunted by the Communists for the rest of my life! I'd better get out there and slaughter them before they murder me! Better get ready for the biggest fight of my life!}
{16129030}{}{I can't believe that I survived that! Hopefully that'll be the last I see of the damn Chinese Communists! This should teach them not to mess with me! I'd better head back to the Hub, and check my mail at the Post Office.}
{16129031}{}{My Overseer just gave me my own Safe House... but something feels off about it. I wonder what's waiting for me over there? I have a bad, bad feeling that I'm about to walk into a trap! I'd better get ready for a huge fight! If I want to find some more answers I guess I'll have to check out this "Safe" House.}
{16129032}{}{Looks like I'm meeting Captain Jason Stone outside of my new house for a one-on-one showdown. Better head over there and teach this guy some manners. Someone is walking away from this fight, and it sure as hell isn't going to be him! I'll never give up! I'll never surrender! Captain Jason Stone must die!}
{16129033}{}{War, war never changes, Captain. You're dead. But why on Earth did I have to kill you?! There must be an answer here somewhere! Better check the body. Hmmm... Yes! Yes! I have Captain Stone's PipBoy now! I can use this to decipher the mystery! But who in California knows how to hack into a PipBoy? I'm sure I could walk right up to Navarro and ask them, but that would be suicide! I should ask Dorothy in the NCR. She's smart, she would know... I hope.   }
{16129034}{}{Dorothy wasn't very helpful. Not one bit. The only thing she mentioned was some sort of Cathedral. I'm guessing she meant the one in L.A. I suppose I should head over there, and ask around inside. Maybe I'll be able to find someone there that can hack into Captain Stone's PipBoy.}
{16129035}{}{What the hell is going on?! Who is this asshole?! Did I just give up Captain Stone's PipBoy for nothing?! That... man... at the Cathedral told me to go over to the Hub... and check my mail! I'd better be careful!}
{16129036}{}{Looks like that PipBoy I brought over to the Cathedral exploded! Better stay away from there for a while! Who knows what kind of damage that may have caused. Right now, I've got two letters that tell me the same thing: Head to the Videocom in NCR, and make a call. I'd better get my ass over there, and figure this out! Who knows who's waiting for me on the other end...}
{16129037}{}{Either someone has tampered with this machine, or my Vault is actually listed under "United States Government". I guess it would make sense. I'd better head over to a Bank and buy another 1248 coins to accept the freakin' charges. Man, this is getting way too expensive! Once I have the All-American Pre-War coins. I'll have to return to the Videocom, and accept those hefty fees.}
{16129038}{}{What?! You mean I need to get another 1248 All-American Pre-War coins?! You've got to be kidding me! Fine! I'll need to head back to that Vault-Tek Videocom once I'm ready, and have the stupid coins.}
{16129039}{}{Great, my Overseer hates my guts for killing his son. And the United States Government wants to take away my PipBoy. What the hell am I going to do now?! I'm in way over my head here, and should try to find some outside assistance! Maybe the NCR government can help me? Maybe I should go speak with an official?}
{16129040}{}{Crap! I can't trust anyone, can I?! Who knows who the Enclave has managed to convert! I need to get the hell out of here, and fast! I guess getting help from the NCR is out of the question. Maybe I should seek shadier sources? I should check out the bars, and see if anyone is tough enough, and mean enough to tango with the goddamn United States Government!}
{16129041}{}{Holy Christ! The Enclave sent a Vertibird after me, along with a small squadron of Enclave Agents! I just saw them land! They're heading this way! I can't avoid this fight, so I'll have to ambush them before they ambush me! Better get ready for a serious fight! The Enclave is going down!}
{16129042}{}{That's the last of them, I hope. No doubt they'll send more. But this should teach them not to fuck with me! I should get out of here, and get back to the Hub to check my mail. Hopefully, the Overseer has calmed down, and has possibly sent me a letter. I wish I could have told him how sorry I was for killing his son. I know how it feels to lose the people you love.}
{16129043}{}{Damn, the Overseer hasn't sent me a letter yet. Maybe something happened to him? Or maybe he thinks that I'm the mole! I really screwed up! But how can I make things right again? I hate to say it, but I'd better go buy some more coins, and try to make a collect call to my vault! I should try to establish a connection first, before I go off and spend more caps.}
{16129044}{}{Thank God I made things right with Vault 24 again! But now, I've been assigned the impossible task of convincing the NCR to fight alongside Vault 24 in a possible upcoming war! How the hell am I going to convince them to do that? Guess I'd better try somewhere...}
{16129045}{}{Looks like the NCR is on my side. I just need to convince the Brotherhood of Steel to join me as well. I should head over to the Lost Hills Bunker, and talk to one of the guards. Let him know that I'm on official business, and need to speak with someone in charge.}
{16129046}{}{I can't believe what just happened! The Brotherhood of Steel wants me to leave California within four years? And help them bring clean water to this entire country? It's... It's such a great idea! Finally, I've found my destiny! The reason why I am alive! I need to save this world! I... I need to bring clean water across the wasteland! It would show EVERYONE just how much we can change things! It's brilliant! But nobody can know that I'm working for the Brotherhood! Right now, I just need to save Vault 24, kick the Enclave out of California, and then get the hell out of Dodge! I should go tell the NCR that the Brotherhood is now on our side. }
{16129047}{}{Better head over to the Vault-Tek Videocom, and place a call to Vault 24. I need to tell the Overseer everything! It's time to go to war with the United States Government!}
{16129048}{}{I need to prepare for war. Get to Level 24 to continue the Story! Once you're tough enough, head over to Gunther in NCR! But oh, no! This story is TO BE CONTINUED! In the next DLC! Stay tuned for more adventures in the land of California!

{16148002}{}{All my efforts of trying to make this world a better place made me sick. I've got post traumatic stress disorder now, and it will probably never go away. I must never forget why I sacrificed so much of myself, for such little in return. The world needs a hero, and I took it upon myself to fulfil that cry. And right now, I can hear them crying over in the Hub.}
{16148003}{}{Everything I've done so far has been such a waste of time. Why even bother feeling remorse for killing? Nobody cares but me. It's this world that does it to you. Where did humanity go wrong? Was it alcohol? Or when people stopped caring about if there was a God or not? Guess it doesn't matter any more.

Better head over to the Hub, and tell Sheriff Hayden the good news.}
{16148005}{}{These choices I've been making with my life are starting to feel really good. I used to think that I was becoming something horrible, but now I can see that I'm becoming something more than just terror. It's time to investigate further into the Hub's criminal underworld. Where to begin? I have no idea... What's this?! A radio call from Sheriff Hayden?! There's a young woman about to be raped somewhere near the Hub!

Better hurry, and get to the bottom of things.}

{16148010}{}{Ugh... where am I? How did I survive that? Who's this guy over there? He looks worse than I do... and he's got a badge! That must be Detective Rockatansky. Better drag myself over there and speak with him.}

I just need to keep that mysterious stranger they call a leader alive so I can interrogate him later. Everything I have done up to now has been meaningless compared to this.

{16214002}{}{I can't help but feel like Joe Kelly is keeping something from me...}
{16214003}{}{All this is too new to me, where the hell am I even going? What the hell am I even going to do with myself? Everything I've ever known is gone! Deep down I guess I feel just like that little girl out there in Old Town... alone... I should go find her and see if I there's anything I can do to help... or... I don't know! I keep hearing people talk about some Vault Dweller, some are even comparing him to me, calling me some kind of hero. I'm no hero, just someone new, a stranger in this town.}
{16214004}{}{Hmm, this place is pretty impressive, guess I'll be here for awhile. Better introduce myself to the local traders, who knows, they could be useful to befriend. I guess I should go find this Beth woman, over in the market.}
{16214005}{}{Looks like Beth is a good woman to trade with, she seems fair. Better go introduce myself to Mitch, up the road.}
{16214006}{}{I need to go get checked for radiation damage, or retina, or whatever! Oh God! I hope they don't give me a suppository! Oh God! Not again! Not. Again!!! There's a clinic to the west of the Market I should go check out, they should be able to take care of me, I hope.}
{16214007}{}{I must be dreaming! I need to go somewhere familiar! A church! Just like the old days! Just like in the vault. I'm coming, father! I'm coming!}
{16214008}{}{Well, I guess that concludes my tour of the Hub. Better figure out what to do with myself for the rest of my life. I can't help but think about what that priest said to me concerning that weird tent out in the wasteland... is there someone waiting for me there? Oh well, better take a deep breath and carry on, there's a big world out there just waiting for me.

There's still cops out here, right? Better skedaddle! I need to go find a spaceship! I should start in the Hub! That seems swell!}
{16294002}{}{Something strange just happened! I received a pile of bones to deliver to one of the prisoners in the Hub! I'd... better hurry up and find out which one! There's no telling what might happen if I don't get these bones to that fucker fast enough!}
{16294003}{}{Feeling compelled, I decided to keep the bones. I should return to the man that knew about the spaceship!}
{16294004}{}{I decided not to keep the bones... They creep me right the fuck out! I should return to the man that knew about the spaceship!}
{16294005}{}{After having lost the bones I decided to act on my own accord, and simply did what felt natural to me at the time. I should return to the man that knew about the spaceship!}
{16294006}{}{Hmm... I received some Gold Nuggets... and a few pieces of Fool's Gold! I wonder what the purpose of this was? I feel like maybe I was given two fake nuggets for a reason! Better keep one safe in case I lose one. I don't think I'll get many second chances! This Fool's Gold must be used for something special! I'd better guard it with my life! Should visit a banker next, maybe get it appraised? Maybe it isn't just Fool's Gold! But something rather supernatural instead!}
{16294007}{}{Tally ho, Muttley! To the city of gold! To the safest town in the city! To Redding! Redding! The city of heroes! And villains, of course! We swim! We fly! We arrive soon!

{16294008}{}{Oh, wow! A glimmering jewel! I wonder what the fuck this is for?! It's too bad that I killed that Jeweler! His knowledge of precious gems would have been useful, damn! I should visit some sort of place... with the word "Golden" in it. Maybe that'll unveil some answers?}
{16294009}{}{That was useful! I feel SOOOO much better now! Yippie! Guess I should go speak with a banker... doesn't matter which city really. I wonder if the Hub has a new banker yet? Muahahhahahahh!! Off to see the banker! The wonderful banker of-- nevermind. Let's just go find a damn banker already!}
{16294010}{}{Guess I'm off looking for the next clue! Oh, boy! It's like a treasure hunt but with actual blood stained treasure! Where the hell am I going to find someone that shouts about Holy Fire though? Hmm... better start SOMEWHERE!

#=======================================
{16336001}{}{Ringhold, the strange dementia ridden ghoul from Necropolis handed me a holotape. On it was his entire life's story, and with it, some fantastical possibilities. Apparently, he's responsible for the creation of the F.E.V, and the wasteland's mutants. What throws me off the most, however, is the fact that he keeps calling me a "Vault Hick", as if somehow he knew me. There's something off about all this, and I'm starting to feel like maybe... just maybe, I should-- could finish his research. Who knows how this might end up. I need to find someone capable, a just as brilliant mind as Ringhold... but where? Perhaps I should ask Ban Chao, over in San Francisco.}
{16336002}{}{After taking the holotape to Ban Chao, in San Francisco, he and I have decided to work together, and continue Ringhold's F.E.V research. However, to further continue the research I'll require a specific Chemistry Journal from Chief Librarian Kohl, over in Vault City. Bao Chao claims that it won't be easy to acquire, but should definitely be worth the visit.}
{16336003}{}{After listening to my story Doctor Kohl laughed at my attempts to get his scientific journals. I guess I should just go back to Ban Chao and tell him the bad news. }
{16336004}{}{I need to head to Necropolis and get a sample of Ringhold's blood. I'll need an empty Hypodermic Needle in order to do it. Just what exactly is Ban Chao plannign to do with his blood?}
{16336005}{}{Now that I have a sample of Ringhold's stolen blood we can continue our little experiment! Better take this back to Ban Chao in San Fran.}
{16336006}{}{Looks like I've got to inject six random drunks, or Holy People with a batch of Ban Chao's new mutagen serum. It's disgusting, and probably murder, but it's for science! Science is never evil, is it?}

{16336013}{}{I've got one final injection of mutagen serum to test out! I just need to find a Homesteader!}
{16336014}{}{That went... well, that went! Let's get back to Ban Chao!}
{16336015}{}{What have I done?! I've just helped the Chinese Communists create a brand new version of the F.E.V! They now have the ability to turn people into Super Mutants! I suppose I'm done with them, for now... but... I could also become a Super Mutant if I paid for the operation. I'll have to speak to Ban Chao later if I'm ever interested.

{16383001}{}{Another day, another journey begins. My city, she calls to me. I am needed. In good, or bad. I walk this scorched Earth, and leave my footprints behind like they're relics. I should begin my journey in the Hub, and speak with Joe Kelly. Let's go find out how the city's doing.}
{16383002}{}{It's time to start digging away at the rotten scum that lurks around this city. I'll start by exterminating the toughest batch of rats this city has to offer.}
{16383003}{}{One more group slaughtered, time for the next task. I should talk to one of the guards outside of the FLC.}
{16383004}{}{It's time to help balance the sense of consequence! Someone has to beat some sense into these lunatics!}
{16383005}{}{This will help set an example for this city. I should go talk to the Sheriff next.}
{16383006}{}{Whether or not I'm a good person... it's better to help the police... rather than fight against them. Time to take out a hardened criminal.}
{16383007}{}{Justice... or whatever this was... is served. Time to hit Old Town, and find that stupid telltale.}
{16383008}{}{Better get out there and murder one of my fellow Vault Dwellers... again...}
{16383009}{}{Rest in pieces, dear brother... whatever you were. I should return to Joe Kelly.}
{16383010}{}{The day grows thin, and my bones are becoming weak. I should rest at my tent for a while. Warm these crackling bones right by the fire.}
{16383011}{}{The New California Republic, where the statue lies. A cold, harsh reminder of the good deeds of the past. Who are we now? What will we become without structure? Without rule. Slaves will always find a master.}
{16383012}{}{Each, and every day the NCR takes new territory thanks to us. Thanks to Vault 24, and our combined efforts. We want our world back. Our age. We want to remember, we want to never forget the way our memories made us feel.}

{16383014}{}{I've decided to collect tribute on behalf of the NCR, I should go around and collect it, then bring it back.}
{16383015}{}{I'm going to slaughter the settlement and leave it for the NCR to clean up! After I'm done here, I'll need to ambush the rest of the settlers outside of the farm. The location is on my map.}
{16383016}{}{Every settlement needs life, it needs water. It needs love. These people can offer a lot to the NCR, and in thus, can help make my life better. I need to go pick up a Water Barrel from the Hub, and bring it back to the settlement.}
{16383017}{}{I should speak with the Torchbearer.}
{16383018}{}{A master always finds his slaves. Time to return to Tandi.}
{16383019}{}{Unification is always better than war. Laws, justice, karma. These things matter. I wonder how well the city's police force is doing? I should head over to the police station.}
{16383020}{}{It's a thin line between good and evil. Everybody succumbs to it once in a while. But does it deserve punishment? Yes, yes it does. A dirty cop is a walking controversy, I don't care who you are. It's time to end the life of another parasite, shitting all over the balance that allows me to be strong, or weak. I'll need to sniff this guy out by investigating the bald-headed cops around the Southern towns, like the Hub, Junktown, L.A, and the NCR.}
{16383021}{}{The things my eyes have seen. The things my people do to try to make a difference. Life is killing me, it's killing my heart. Just like the black heart of this corrupt, paedophile cop I'm about to kill!}
{16383022}{}{May the children rest in piece, and God have no mercy on your broken soul. You fucking bastard. I need a drink! Better head to the Maltese Falcon, and find Hope.}
{16383023}{}{I should return to Detective Deckard, tell him the good news about justice. No rush though, I should relax. Eat something while I'm here, and listen to the music.}
{16383024}{}{I need to rest my wary bones down by the fire, and pay a visit to my one, and only true friend.}
{16383025}{}{Junktown now calls to me. A place where ruin is now civilization. The wreckage of yesterday now paves the way into tomorrow. It is haunted in the night, by a ghost of a once great species, The Night Terror. If I haven't solved that riddle before, I should do so now before continuing.}
{16383026}{}{Once again I must hunt. Hunt a creature of pure nightmare fuel. I need to gather 50x pieces of Meat, and find a Junktown Scout out in the wasteland in order to help me set the trap.}
{16383027}{}{I need to kill the Ancient Deathclaw, and ensure the safety of the people of Junktown. Their brewery makes too good of beer to let their legacy go to waste.}
{16383028}{}{Grimlok is dead, and I should return to Jeb in Junktown.}
{16383029}{}{Nothing raises the spirits more than the nectar of the Gods. Nothing sparks birth, emotion, thought, and civilization more than alcohol. I should head over to the Junktown Brewery and help them spread the good word of Baccus. After I've completed whatever tasks they need to help open, I should return to them and double check if they've got everything ready to set up.}
{16383030}{}{I need to deliver a crate full of Beer to the bartender at the Maltese Falcon. Better not lose it!}
{16383031}{}{I should head back to the Junktown Brewery to pick up another crate.}

{16383035}{}{I'm done delivering crates of Beer for Junktown's Brewery. Better head back and let them know that the job is done.}
{16383036}{}{Looks like the day is almost done, I should rest back at my fire for a bit.}
{16383037}{}{The day is complete, and I am no longer in need of rest. I crave entertainment, vice, and the enjoyment of this short lived life. I should feed my own desires, before letting anyone else in this world control me. I *need* to go to Reno, and party.}
{16383038}{}{I've earned my first party point! Nice! Time to keep on rockin' my socks off in Reno, baby! Yeah!}
{16383039}{}{I've earned my second party point! Yeah! Time to earn another! Let's party like it's 2238!}
{16383040}{}{I've earned my third party point! Woo! Time to drink another beer! I'm in Reno, baby! Get loose!}
{16383041}{}{I'm on my fourth beer, I mean party point! Ah, who cares! I'm in Reno, baby! Let's get loaded!}
{16383042}{}{I should fight everyone in here... just for fun. But first? I need another beer.}
{16383043}{}{I've earned another party point! This is my sixth one! After everything I've done, and seen, I think I'm almost ready for another beer!}
{16383044}{}{I've earned my seventh party point! Is this even beer?! Who knows! I'm drunk!}
{16383045}{}{Why the hell does that bartender keep mentioning a comedian? I should order another beer and find out!}
{16383046}{}{I've earned my ninth party point! What I do now with my body I can no longer be accounted for. I should finally go see that damn comedian, and call it a night. Just... one more beer.}
{16383047}{}{I've earned my tenth party point! Nice! I'm so drunk right now! I should probably call it a night, but I don't remember if I've seen that damn comedian yet! I... should have another beer!}
{16383048}{}{I'm drunk! Time to go home! But first... another beer!}
{16383049}{}{The day will soon end for me, and after all I've seen, and done. I think the day and I are even. For everything. I'm not perfect, and I never will be. But at least... my heart... is where it needs to be. I should drag myself back to the fire, before I pass out.}
{16383050}{}{It's time to check my mail in the Hub, and call it a day.}
{16383051}{}{Freedom, choice, luxury. Things that are not often mixed in with the so called "apocalypse", but I have that here, despite the madness. I want to continue its dream, for tomorrow is...

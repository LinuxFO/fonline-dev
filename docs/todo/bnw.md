# BNW

## CRLF

CRLF vs LF is old engine vs foclassic 'newer' 3.12 engine version, newer is LF only, except in factions data file, bc AS script there for some reason reads based on CRLF.

## ID changes

ID changes in BNW compared to S2 were made by me to normalize the all around ID's, it might be annoying in hindsight for people having a lot of content on old ID's, these ID changes are for maps, dialogs and quest variables mostly.

Two features depends on new ID's:

- Old dialog editor when finding quest var (ID's) since the dialog editor sorts them by value, not alphabetically (maybe it would have been better to enchance the dialog editor).
- New BNW feature that allows to set some NPC dialogs to be important, by default recoloring their names to golden color, or for job NPC to teal color, etc, this features is in newest BNW only, and not in the last years mid summer snapshot.
